abstract = {In this paper we have discussed what appears to be a superior implementation of the Algebraic Reconstruction Technique (ART). The method is based on 1) simultaneous application of the error correction terms as computed by ART for all rays in a given projection; 2) longitudinal weighting of the correction terms back-distributed along the rays; and 3) using bilinear elements for discrete approximation to the ray integrals of a continuous image. Since this implementation generates a good reconstruction in only one iteration, it also appears to have a computational advantage over the more traditional implementation of ART. Potential applications of this implementation include image reconstruction in conjunction with ray tracing for ultrasound and microwave tomography in which the curved nature of the rays leads to a non-uniform ray density across the image.}

abstract = {We give a new method for direct reconstruction of three-dimensional objects from a few electron micrographs taken at angles which need not exceed a range of 60 degrees. The method works for totally asymmetric objects, and requires little computer time or storage. It is also applicable to X-ray photography, and may greatly reduce the exposure compared to current methods of body-section radiography.}

abstract = {Assessing the quality of images is a challenging task. To achieve this goal, images must be evaluated by a pool of subjects following a well-defined protocol or an objective quality metric must be defined. In this work, an objective quality metric based on deep neural network is proposed. The metric takes into account the human vision system by computing the saliency map and natural scene statistics features of the image under test. The neural network is composed by two modules: the convolutional layers and the regression units. The first one is trained by using preprocessed distorted images. The feature weights of the first module are smoothed by exploiting the estimated saliency map. The latter module is fit with the ground truth quality scores of the input image and the scaled feature weights obtained from first module by using visual sensitivity factor of image obtained using natural scene statistics features. The performances of the proposed metric have been evaluated by using four datasets: LIVEIQA, TID2013, CSIQ, and KADID10K. The achieved results show the effectiveness of the proposed system in closely matching the predicted quality scores with the ground truth ones.}
